#Recipe Searcher

###About:
This was a little passion project that was my first ever attempt at making a
working programme using Python. It isn't much but it's honest work. It's my
little piece to muck about with and have a go at trying new things. 
Thankfully, I have gone back to re-organise everything and will slowly update it.
This was before I learnt about PEP8 compliance and TDD after a 6 x 2 hours coding course with CFG
It doesn't have a GUI at present, which will be added with time!

##How to use:
This recipe searcher uses Edamam API to connect to a database full of recipes to give you ideas on what to cook and when.
To be able to interact with the Edamam API you will need to create an ID and API Key via Edamam:

I recommend including these in a .env file in your local environment
